How to contribute on a social and technical level

# Technically - how to contribute

* You can view this project here or on [gitbooks](https://www.gitbook.com/book/revolutionsundays/wikipolitics/details). 
* You can edit it locally \(via `git` or `gitbooks-cli`\), or directly on github
* forking and pull requests
* if you want to be a **maintainer**, get in touch with existing maintainers \(jessykate, or others who enter their name here as volunteers to manage maintainers :\)\). 

## Process for contributions

* Optionally, [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). "Forking" copies the repository to your account, so you can make any changes you want. If you don't do this manually, you will be prompted to do so anyway, any time you edit a file. 
* Make your changes and save. 
* When you save the file, you will be prompted to make a pull request. 
  * WTF is a pull request? [Pull request explainer](http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2014/10/06/editing-on-github-a-non-technical-explainer/).
* one of the maintainers will review it and assess against our [basic rules](https://github.com/revolutionsundays/wikipolitics/blob/master/meta/overview.md#rules) and merge or discuss. 

# Socially - how to contribute

* Contributions should follow the rules for updating the rules
* Specifically... \(needs more detail here\). 
* Contentious contributions...
* Forks of this repo... for those of us involved with this project, we'd rather see multiple viewpoints represented in one wiki, than a hard fork. that said, if there is a fundamental difference of opinion on the meta-values or how to manage contributions, then a fork might be very appropriate. we will be happy to discuss with you and work to find ways of collaborating.
