# Contributing
How to contribute on a social and technical level

# Technically - how to contribute 
* You can view this project here or on [gitbooks](https://www.gitbook.com/book/revolutionsundays/wikipolitics/details). 
* You can edit it locally (via `git` or `gitbooks-cli`), or directly on github
* forking and pull requests
* if you want to be a **maintainer**, get in touch with existing maintainers (jessykate, or others who enter their name here as volunteers to manage maintainers :)). 

## Process for contributions
* optionally, fork the repo
* make your changes
* if you do not have direct write access to the repo, it will be "forked" for you (copied to your own account), so you can make any changes you want. 
* when you save the file, you will be prompted to make a pull request. 
  * WTF is a pull request? [Pull request explainer](http://michaeljaylissner.com/posts/2014/10/06/editing-on-github-a-non-technical-explainer/).
* one of the maintainers will review it and assess against our [basic rules](https://github.com/revolutionsundays/wikipolitics/blob/master/meta/overview.md#rules) and merge or discuss. 

# Socially - how to contribute
* Contributions should follow the rules for updating the rules
* Specifically... (needs more detail here). 
* Contentious contributions...
* Forks of this repo... for those of us involved with this project, we'd rather see multiple viewpoints represented in one wiki, than a hard fork. that said, if there is a fundamental difference of opinion on the meta-values or how to manage contributions, then a fork might be very appropriate. we will be happy to discuss with you and work to find ways of collaborating.
