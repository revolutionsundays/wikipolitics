## Goal 
A participatory, meritocratic, social policy decision preparation system.

## Rules

1. **Open participation:** anyone can participate who is able to contribute within these rules (regardless of race, sex, origin, material make-up (e.g. carbon or silicon), speciesâ€¦), & including whether that person is within or without any system choosing to implement the conclusions made herein -- i.e. participaction is not limited to those being governed by it. 
1. **Substantiated:** arguments given must be backed up with valid reason-based or empirical backing, and appropriate caveating of confidence interval.
1. **Diverse:** welcoming of diverse viewpoints -- encouraging of alternate substantiated viewpoints for and against any position (not to say we will all agree with the conclusion).
1. **Rules for changing the rules:** changes are welcome that help in practice/empirically with the goal of making the best system for decision making.

## Use

* A forum to deliberate and conclude the best policies for society writ large _regardless of capacity/power of the community of participants to enact said policy._
* A forum to deliberate and conclude the _policies to be enacted by the Community Council_ -- decision making bodies for a growing community of intentional citizens using their homes and communities as a platform for new political systems.

## Not for

* Decision making -- the actual decison making within any society is up to them. Wikipolitics is just a reference for information and only one process for developing that reference.
