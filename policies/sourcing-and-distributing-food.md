# Sourcing and Distributing Food

Concepts such as carbon footprints and food miles, humane treatment of animals, ecosystems management, and waste reduction are all big concerns for ethical eaters. As our ability to take all of these to the extreme increases, we’ll need to assess the tradeoffs between these axes of choice, perhaps creating new standards of sustainability which account for each of these impacts.

The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development defines sustainability as_ “ensuring that we meet our needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”_

## Axes of impact

**Labor issues** – Agriculture and food processing are among the most difficult, most dangerous, and lowest paid occupations in the US.

**Animal welfare** – Improper confinement and handling of animals can cause stress, pain, injuries and chronic disease, all contributing to animal mortality. 

**Hormones and non‐therapeutic antibiotics** – Used to promote animal growth and productivity, these treatments can result in antibiotic resistant bacteria and other human health concerns. 

**Genetic modification of crops and livestock** – With limited long‐term testing of GMOs, the precautionary principle raises concerns for potential human health and environmental impacts. 

**Toxicity **– Conventional agriculture relies heavily on pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides, which, used improperly, threaten both human and environmental health. 

**Water conservation and quality** – Agriculture represents 84% of freshwater used in the US. Environmental Protection Agency studies also identify agriculture as the leading source of ground and surface water contamination. 

**Soil conservation and health** – Tillage, wind and water erosion, and use of soil fumigants and other chemicals all contribute to depletion of soils. 

**Global warming** – Agriculture is a known source of nitrogen from soil degradation, methane from animal waste, ozone‐depleting chemicals, carbon dioxide from farm equipment and transportation, and additional energy is used for food processing, packaging and refrigeration. 

**Protection of wildlife** – Ninety percent of threatened species in the US are known to spend some portion of their life cycle on privately owned agricultural lands. 

**Local economies** – Family‐scale agriculture and food processing are under significant economic pressure due to consolidation in industry, and increasingly international trade. 

**Food quality and safety** – Concerns have been raised for food additives used to extend shelf‐life or enhance color and flavor, for contaminants, and for food‐borne illnesses like e‐coli. 

**Diet‐related health concerns** – Diet is closely linked with the increasing incidence of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and other preventable causes of sickness and death.



#### This is impossible to assess in a way that is generalizable for all geographic locations, so here we use San Francisco as an example.
